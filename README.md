# Forkify
App which help find many delicious recipes.

In this project I worked with API's, webpack, babel, JavaScript ES 2015+ etc. This API can handle only 50 calls per day, so don't play too hard:)
You can try it online at https://frozenpyrozen.github.io/Forkify/dist/
You can change servings, add/remove ingridents in order list. add food in liked list.
To run this project just download it and type: ```npm run start```
